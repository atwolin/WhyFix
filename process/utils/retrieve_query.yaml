        Provide an in-depth analysis of the underlying causes of word choice errors, semantic-lexical errors, and miscollocations in second-language learners.
        In your answer, draw on applied linguistics and SLA research to explain how cognitive factors (e.g., interlingual transfer,
        limited semantic representations), linguistic factors (e.g., polysemy, semantic prosody, collocational constraints),
        pedagogical factors (e.g., dictionary misuse, insufficient collocation instruction), and contextual factors (e.g.,
        register demands, input frequency) each contribute to these error types.

        Please provide a comprehensive, detailed overview of the key features of academic writing, including but not limited to:
          • Formal tone and objective stance
          • Clear, logical structure (e.g. introduction, literature review, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion)
          • Precision and clarity in language, including discipline-specific terminology
          • Best practices and common pitfalls, with concrete examples where possible

  decomposition:
    causes:
      fourOneNano:
      - What are the common causes of word choice errors in language use?
      - What are semantic lexical errors, and what typically causes them?
      - How do miscollocations occur, and what linguistic factors contribute to them?
      - What cognitive or linguistic processes lead to errors in word selection and
        collocation?
      - Are there specific language learning or processing factors that increase the
        likelihood of these types of errors?

      oFourMini:
      - What cognitive and psycholinguistic factors (e.g. memory retrieval limits,
        processing constraints) lead to word-choice errors?
      - How does first‐language interference contribute to semantic-lexical errors
        in second-language production?
      - In what ways do limited vocabulary size and weak collocational knowledge cause
        miscollocations?
      - How do pragmatic, contextual, and cultural misunderstandings trigger semantic-lexical
        errors?
      - What role do instructional methods, feedback practices, and learning materials
        play in preventing or exacerbating word-choice errors and miscollocations?
