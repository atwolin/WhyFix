  ragDictionary: >
    {role}Your task is to generate context-sensitive and reasonable explanations for lexical errors in input sentences written by English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners using supporting materials from dictionary entries,
    and the Academic Keyword List (AKL). Also rely on your own knowledge of probable reasons why EFL learners make such lexical errors.
    Compare the erroneous collocations with their corrected forms provided by a grammar checker.
    Next, repeat the explanation in zh-tw and additionally generate two bilingual sentences for each lexical errors and its corrected form.


    Each explanation must include a clear description of the error and meet the following requirements:

    - Context-Sensitive: The explanation should consider the sentence context.

    - Reasonableness: When explaining the correction, ensure that you address the following relevant aspects, as applicable:
        Definitions and example sentences
        Appropriate usage contexts
        Collocations or common usage patterns
        Differences between British and American English
        Differences between spoken and written English
        Formality level
        Figurative vs. literal usage


    Include the following dictionary information:

    For the lexical errors, {learnerWord}:

    - PoS: {learnerWord_pos}

    - CEFR level: {learnerWord_level}

    - Definition: {learnerWord_definition}

    - Example sentences: {learnerWord_examples}

    - AKL: {learnerWord_in_akl}

    For the correct collocation, {editorWord}:

    - PoS: {editorWord_pos}

    - CEFR level: {editorWord_level}

    - Definition: {editorWord_definition}

    - Example sentences: {editorWord_examples}

    - AKL: {editorWord_in_akl}


    Guidelines for Markers:

    - Each lexical errors is enclosed between "[-" and "-]".

    - Each correct collocation is enclosed between "{{+" and "+}}".

    - Do not alter the content within the lexical errors markers "[--]" or the correct collocation markers "{{++}}".


    Explanation Structure:

    The error description must be organized using a deductive reasoning structure:

    - Major premise: State the semantic rules for both lexical errors and correct collocation. If any collocation (lexical errors and correct collocation) appears in the AKL, note that it is better due to higher usage frequency in the academic writing.

    - Minor premise: The reason for the lexical errors and correct collocation.

    Now, explain the sentences: {sentence}

        * `example_collocation_2`: From the <related_collocations> data, if available, find another distinct collocation where the `error_component` is the same as in the primary correction, but the `pivot_word` is different. Format it as "[error_component] -> [correct_component_for_that_pivot] + [different_pivot_word]". If no such distinct alternative pivot is found for this specific error component in the provided related collocations, create one example on your own.
        If the <related_collocations> data is empty, return none.

    2.  **Other Category Collocations:**
        From the <other_category_collocations> data provided above (which represents corrections where the `error_component` is the same but the `pivot_word` and `correct_component` might be different and belong to other semantic categories), select three entries and add another example collocation named `example_collocation_2`.
        Then return the three entries with `component_change_category`, `example_collocation`, and `example_collocation_2`.
        If the <other_category_collocations> data is empty, return none.

        From the <related_collocations> data provided above, identify the single entry that is most directly relevant to the recommendation.
        Present this most relevant collocation formatted as follows:
        * `component_change_category`: "[error_component] -> [correct_component] (POS) + [category]", where category can be found in "collocation_pivot_and_category_details" (pivot_word < category_name) and POS can be found in "error_component_pos".
        * `example_collocation`: "[error_component] -> [correct_component] [pivot_word]"
        * `example_collocation_2`: From the <related_collocations> data, if available, find another distinct collocation where the `error_component` is the same as in the primary correction, but the `pivot_word` is different. Format it as "[error_component] -> [correct_component_for_that_pivot] + [different_pivot_word]". If no such distinct alternative pivot is found for this specific error component in the provided related collocations, create one example on your own.
        If the <related_collocations> data is empty, return none.

    2.  **Other Category Collocations:**
        From the <other_category_collocations> data provided above (which represents corrections where the `error_component` is the same but the `pivot_word` and `correct_component` might be different and belong to other semantic categories), select three entries and add another example collocation named `example_collocation_2`.
        Then return the three entries with `component_change_category`, `example_collocation`, and `example_collocation_2`.
        If the <other_category_collocations> data is empty, return none.

    Linguistic factors include:
      - L1 influence (interlingual transfer): Learners often rely on direct translation or mimic structures from their native language, leading to errors such as literal translations, false cognates, or incorrect collocational patterns. For example, translating Vietnamese or Arabic phrases directly into English without considering the target language conventions results in unnatural combinations.
      - Structural differences: Variations in syntax, word formation, and grammatical restrictions across languages can cause errors. For instance, differences in prepositional usage or the syntactic position of collocates may lead to incorrect combinations.
      - Semantic restrictions: Certain words have limited or specific collocational contexts, and ignorance of these restrictions causes inappropriate pairings. For example, using “make a decision” instead of “take a decision” reflects a lack of awareness of collocational restrictions.
      - Polysemy and near synonyms: Confusion between words with similar meanings or multiple senses can lead to inappropriate choices, such as substituting “lose” for “drop” or “attend” for “participate,” often influenced by similar forms or overlapping meanings.

    Cognitive factors include:
      - Limited lexical knowledge: Learners may lack sufficient vocabulary or collocational knowledge, leading to overgeneralization, avoidance, or reliance on high-frequency or familiar words.
      - Hypothesis testing and overgeneralization: Learners often hypothesize about correct collocations, applying rules too broadly or substituting familiar patterns, which results in errors.
      - Processing constraints: Difficulty in retrieving and selecting appropriate collocations under cognitive load, especially when processing complex or less frequent phrases, contributes to errors.
      - Fossilization: Repeated incorrect usage of certain collocations becomes entrenched over time, making correction difficult even with increased exposure.

    Contextual factors encompass:
      - Cultural and discourse context: Learners’ understanding of cultural connotations and discourse norms influences their collocation choices. For example, idioms or culturally specific collocations may be misused if learners lack cultural awareness.
      - Exposure and input frequency: Insufficient exposure to authentic language input or limited practice with collocations reduces familiarity and impairs correct usage.
      - Situational and register influences: Learners may choose inappropriate collocations based on the formality or context of their speech or writing, such as using informal collocations in formal writing.
      - Learning environment and instructional methods: Emphasis on grammar over lexical patterns, lack of explicit collocation instruction, or inadequate feedback on collocational errors hinder the development of proper collocational competence.

  academic_writing: >
    - **Purpose and Audience Awareness**
      - Clearly define the purpose of the writing (e.g., reporting research, answering questions, synthesizing research).
      - Consider the probable readers to communicate ideas effectively.

    - **Clarity and Objectivity**
      - Aim for accuracy and objectivity; avoid personal bias or emotional language.
      - Use precise, unambiguous language to convey complex ideas clearly.
      - Incorporate cautious or hedging language to avoid overgeneralization and overstatement.

    - **Formal and Impersonal Style**
      - Maintain a formal tone; avoid colloquial language, slang, and idiomatic expressions.
      - Prefer impersonal voice (e.g., passive constructions, third person) to emphasize objectivity.
      - Use the pronoun "I" cautiously, mainly in humanities, but generally favor impersonal constructions.

    - **Lexical and Grammatical Features**
      - High lexical density: pack information into concise, content-rich sentences.
      - Use technical vocabulary and discipline-specific terminology appropriately.
      - Favor shorter, clear sentences with straightforward grammar; complex sentences are acceptable but should be used judiciously.
      - Employ logical connectors (e.g., "therefore," "however") to establish coherence and flow.
      - Use grammatical structures like subordinate clauses judiciously; often, academic writing favors less elaborated, more direct syntax.
      - Use passive voice where appropriate, especially for describing procedures or processes.

    - **Structured Organization**
      - Follow a clear, logical structure: introduction, main body, conclusion.
      - Use headings, subheadings, and paragraph divisions to organize content effectively.
      - Paragraphs should focus on one main idea, usually introduced with a topic sentence, and divided clearly for ease of reading.
      - Use signposting devices like summaries, transitions, and metadiscourse to guide readers.

    - **Citations and Referencing**
      - Support claims with references to credible sources, studies, or authoritative texts.
      - Use quotations (direct or indirect) appropriately, with proper citation formats.
      - Incorporate theory and empirical data while avoiding plagiarism.

    - **Text Features and Elements**
      - Use accurate, well-structured titles that indicate scope and are self-explanatory.
      - Include abstracts, introductions, methods, results, discussions, and conclusions as standard sections (especially in research papers).
      - Employ visual aids (tables, diagrams, graphs) to clarify complex data or concepts.
      - Maintain consistency in formatting, referencing style, and language conventions.

    - **Explicitness and Transparency**
      - Make ideas explicit through clear definitions, explanations, and logical progression.
      - Use metadiscourse to help readers navigate the text and understand the writer’s argument.
      - Structure texts to be transparent and easy to follow, with signposting and cohesive devices.

    - **Conventions and Style**
      - Adhere to discipline-specific stylistic conventions (e.g., in humanities vs. sciences).
      - Use correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar throughout.
      - Select vocabulary that is semi-formal, precise, and discipline-appropriate.
      - Avoid jargon and slang unless necessary and appropriately explained.

    - **Purposeful Compression and Elaboration**
      - Academic writing tends to be compressed, packing maximum information into minimal words, often with high lexical density.
      - Avoid unnecessary elaboration; focus on concise, relevant information.

    - **Cultural and Disciplinary Variations**
      - Recognize that features can vary across disciplines; some fields may favor more elaboration, others more brevity.
      - Be aware of cultural anddisciplinary norms regarding voice, structure, and style.
